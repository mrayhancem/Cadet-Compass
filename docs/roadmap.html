          This roadmap prevents “late discovery” in Grade 11. It keeps two pillars constant: <strong>academics</strong> and
          <strong>character/leadership</strong>, while making actions more specific each year depending on the pathway you choose.

        The generator includes a graduation overlay each year so students do not pursue a military pathway while falling behind on
        graduation basics. These items are placeholders you can edit to match SST policy exactly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Credits tracking:</strong> on-track each year toward diploma plan</li>
        <li><strong>EOCs:</strong> pass required state assessments (as applicable)</li>
        <li><strong>LOTE / Endorsement alignment:</strong> stay on pathway plan</li>
        <li><strong>Community service hours:</strong> document hours for leadership/service evidence</li>
        <li><strong>Attendance / discipline:</strong> supports “whole-person” review and enlistment qualification</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>What students miss most often (common failure points)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Waiting until Grade 11 to start leadership and fitness.</li>
        <li>Assuming “good grades” alone are enough for competitive officer programs.</li>
        <li>Not building a backup plan (ROTC, Guard/Reserve, enlistment → later commissioning).</li>
        <li>Not using official sources to verify current requirements.</li>
        <li>Falling behind on graduation requirements while focusing on applications.</li>
